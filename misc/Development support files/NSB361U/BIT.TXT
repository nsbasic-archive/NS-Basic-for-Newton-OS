NS BASIC and NIE (Newton Internet Enabler)                  September 12, 1996------------------------------------------------------------------------------NS BASIC makes a very handy tool for accessing the internet. With it, you can create custom mail, news and web applications. By loading the BASIC iNet Tool (BIT) onto your system, you add a set of easy to use functions to NS BASIC that let you cruise the net from your Newt.Table of Contents-----------------1.

The handling is very easy. Everybody with a little knowledge of Internet-protocols could do his own Newsreader, Emailreader, etc...  Great...;))))""BIT looks like a very fun tool. A superb addition to a more and more professional product."1. Prerequisites----------------1. Newton MessagePad 130. (A Newton 120 2.0 probably has insufficient memory for this).2. The Newton Internet Enabler (NIE) must be installed. (Available from http://devworld.apple.com/dev/newton/tools/nie.html3. A modem4. An account with an Internet Service Provider (ISP)5. Internet Setup must have been performed6. NS BASIC 3.0 or newer, installed on the Internal store.7. Basic iNet Tool (BIT) must also be installed on the Internal store.2. General Comments----------------The NS BASIC internet interface is designed to be very easy to use. In this document, we give some of the basics on accessing different internet services.A good resource on how the internet works in general is located at http://www.freesoft.org/Connected. You might want to look at this to get information on more advanced uses of the internet services.The BASIC iNet Tool is an add on piece of software which NS BASIC uses to access the Newton Internet Enabler. Small (less that 15K), it greatly simplifies the code needed in the NS BASIC program.3. How to use the BASIC Internet Tool (BIT)-------------------------------------------To initialize BIT, put the following statement into your program:BIT:=getroot().|bit:nsbasic|You can now access the additional variables provided by BIT by referring to the in your program as BIT.<slotname>. To call a function, use the expression U.BIT:<funcname>(<parameters>).BIT runs as a background task. You can ask it to do something, and leave it to run while you do other processing. Note that if you do so, you will take cycles away from BIT and it will take longer for it to work. Running BIT as a background task allows you to do a bit of housekeeping in NS BASIC and to set up a WAIT loop that can time out if BIT takes too long to reply.Here are important variables and functions in BIT:mConnect() This function establishes the connection. Before it can be called, the variables BIT.fConfigAddr and BIT.fConfigRPort must be set. If the phone connection has not been made, this function will also establish it, using the defaults in Internet Setup.Send(text)This function sends the text and clears u.fReceiveBuffer.CancelRequest(nil)This function allows you to cancel an outstanding request.Receive(text)This function returns a copy of current contents of BIT.fReceiveBuffer and clears it.Cleanup()This function releases the connection and frees up the memory used by the connection.Rev()This function returns the current rev of BIT.The following variables are used by BIT:fEndPointState    var   0 if idle, 1 if connected.fReceiveBuffer    var   string data received from net. Max size is 8000.fConfigAddr       var   string net address to accessfConfigRPort      var   integer port number to access. See Appendix A.fstatus           var   the current status4. News----------------To connect with news, use address "nntp.netcruiser" and port 119. (The address will be different with your service provider; the port will be standard. See Appendix A for a complete list of ports). For complete documentation on how to talk to a news server, see http://freesoft.mesa.net/Connected/RFC/977/You'll get an initial welcome message back:"200 tor-nn1.netcom.ca InterNetNews NNRP server INN 1.4unoff4 05-Mar-96 ready (posting ok)."Tell it what newsgroup you want:group alt.food.wineYou'll get back :211 206 16868 17075 alt.food.wineThis means there are 206 articles, numbered from 16868 to 17075.To read the headers of some of the articles, sendxover 17000-17005You'll get back:"17070	Re: Old Liebfraumich...

WWW----------------To connect with a web server, use address "www.nsbasic.com" and port 80. (The address will be different depending on the web server you wish to access; the port will be standard. See Appendix A for a complete list of ports).To get a web page,GET http://www.nsbasic.com/The data will come back and the connection will be closed. Note that while News lines end with CR/LF, web information that returns may end in just LF. At the end of receiving a page of data, the server closes the connection, so to see if the page is complete, wait for the connection to be terminated.Web sites also have local programs that get run, using something called cgi. For example, to check a stock price, connect to location www.dbc.com and do the following command:GET /cgi-bin/htx.exe/squote?TICKER=DOCSFOne NS BASIC quirk to look out for: the "//" that often appears as part of a URL confuses the NS BASIC scanner, which also takes // to mean the beginning of a comment on a statement line. To get around this, you may need to enter the URL as "GET http:/" & "/www.nsbasic.com/.See the sample code in Appendix B for an example of accessing a web page.6. Getting Mail----------------The program most commonly used to read news on a server is called POP3. Documentation for this can be found at http://www.imc.org/rfc1939.To connect with a POP3 server, use address "netcom.ca" and port 110. (The address will be different depending on the web server you wish to access; the port will be standard. See Appendix A for a complete list of ports).Here's a sample of the underlying dialogue that takes place. In your NS BASIC program, you'll duplicate this dialog. Lines entered by the user start with U:U: telnet netcom.ca 110Trying 207.93.1.148...Connected to netcom.ca.Escape character is '^]'.+OK NETCOM v0.1 at tor-srs1 starting : built on Aug  2 1996 14:00:08.U: user ghenne+OK Password required for ghenne.U: PASS xxxxxx+OK ghenne has 0 message(s) (0 octets).U: STAT+OK 3 1766U: DELE 3+OK Message 3 has been deleted.U: LIST+OK 2 messages (1425 octets)1 8012 624.U: DELE 2+OK Message 2 has been deleted.U: RETR 1+OK 801 octetsReturn-Path: <gh@nsbasic.com>Received: from deliverator.io.com by tor-srs1.netcom.ca (8.7.5/SMI-4.1/Netcom)        id PAA17679; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 15:28:22 -0400 (EDT)From: gh@nsbasic.comReceived: from tor-srs1.netcom.ca (tor-srs1.netcom.ca [207.93.1.148]) by deliverator.io.com (8.7.5/8.7.3) with ESMTP id OAA16463 for <gh@nsbasic.com>; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 14:24:42 -0500 (CDT)Received: from pentagon.io.com by tor-srs1.netcom.ca (8.7.5/SMI-4.1/Netcom)        id PAA16699; Tue, 27 Aug 1996 15:23:18 -0400 (EDT)Date: Tue, 27 Aug 1996 15:23:18 -0400 (EDT)Message-Id: <199608271923.PAA16699@tor-srs1.netcom.ca>This is line 1 of my messageand line 2..U: QUIT+OK Pop server at  signing off.Connection closed by foreign host.See the sample code in Appendix B for an example of reading mail.7. Sending Mail----------------The most common program used to send mail is SMTP. Documentation for SMTP can be found at http://www.freesoft.org/Connected/RFC/821/1.htmlTo connect with a SMTP server, use address "netcom.ca" and port 25. (The address will be different depending on the web server you wish to access; the port will be standard. See Appendix A for a complete list of ports).Here's a sample of the underlying dialogue that takes place. In your NS BASIC program, you'll duplicate this dialog. Lines entered by the user start with U:U: telnet netcom.ca 25Trying 207.93.1.148...Connected to netcom.ca.Escape character is '^]'.220 tor-srs1.netcom.ca ESMTP Sendmail 8.7.5/SMI-4.1/Netcom ready at Tue, 27 Aug 1996 15:23:06 -0400 (EDT)U: HELO io.com250 tor-srs1.netcom.ca Hello nsbasic@pentagon.io.com [199.170.88.5], pleased to meet youU: MAIL FROM: gh@nsbasic.com250 gh@nsbasic.com...

Testing Stuff out using Telnet---------------------------------Telnet is another of the basic services provided on the net. It allows you to establish a low level connection with any port on a service provider. There are a number of Telnet implementations available for for PCs and Macs.You can test most of this stuff out using Telnet and your PC or Mac. Connect to your service provider, and start up telnet. (Unfortunately, not all ISP's allow you to access Telnet: Netcom is a good example. Let them know how you feel!) Once in telnet, you can typetelnet netcom.ca 25The first argument is the address of the service provider and the second is the port number you want to connect to.Try testing the commands you want to issue manually before writing an NS BASIC program to perform them.Unfortunately, it's not so easy to create a Telnet application from NS BASIC. Telnet relies on special escape characters for its processing, which can appear at any point in the transmission. This requires character by character processing of the incoming data, which would need to be done a very low level routine - the standard code provided by Apple as part of the Newton Internet Enabler isn't set up for this.Appendix A: List of standard internet port numbers--------------------------------------------------tcpmux          1/tcp                           # TCP port multiplexer (RFC1078)echo            7/tcpecho            7/udpdiscard         9/tcp           sink nulldiscard         9/udp           sink nullsystat          11/tcp          usersdaytime         13/tcpdaytime         13/udpnetstat         15/tcpqotd            17/tcp          quotechargen         19/tcp          ttytst sourcechargen         19/udp          ttytst sourceftp             21/tcptelnet          23/tcpsmtp            25/tcp          mailtime            37/tcp          timservertime            37/udp          timserverrlp             39/udp          resource        # resource locationnameserver      42/tcp          name            # IEN 116whois           43/tcp          nicnamedomain          53/tcp          nameserver      # name-domain serverdomain          53/udp          nameservermtp             57/tcp                          # deprecatedbootps          67/udp          bootp           # bootp serverbootpc          68/udp                          # bootp clienttftp            69/udpgopher          70/tcprje             77/tcp          netrjsfinger          79/tcplink            87/tcp          ttylinksupdup          95/tcphostnames       101/tcp         hostname        # usually from sri-nictsap            102/tcp                         # part of ISODE.pop2            109/tcp                         # old pop portpop             110/tcp         pop3 postofficesunrpc          111/tcpsunrpc          111/udpident           113/tcp         auth tap authenticationsftp            115/tcpuucp-path       117/tcpnntp            119/tcp         readnews untp   # USENET News Transfer Protocolntp             123/udp         ntpdimap            143/tcpsnmp            161/udp                         # network time protocolsnmp-trap       162/udpsmux            199/tcpAppendix B: Program Listing---------------------------0010  rem demonstrate internet access -- IN0015  cls0020  print "Demonstrate Internet Access"0030  print0040  print "A.
