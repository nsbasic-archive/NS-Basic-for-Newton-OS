What is your role within the Newton Group?A. I am one of eight people in the Program Managers group within theEngineering organization. We manage the "big picture" of various projectswithin the group.  We do this by carefully balancing features, quality,resources and schedule to drive a project to completion. On a day-to-daybasis, we are responsible for establishing and tracking the projectschedule, identifying and resolving issues, and ensuring effectivecommunications across all constituents of the project. A previous managerdescribed this as "connecting the dots".Q. What project are you working on now?A. I am program managing the localization of the Newton OS to the Germanlanguage, as well as the overall  schedule for the other pieces that makeup the "Whole Product Solution".  There is a team of about 15 directlyresponsible people, with the goal to have over 30 pieces of the "WholeProduct Solution" ready at the same time -  a challenge that always keepsthings interesting!Q. What are the opportunities for our developers in German-speaking countries?A. Marketing is very excited about the possibilities of the platform. Thereare many market opportunities in Germany, especially verticalmarkets such as health care, sales force automation and field service. Thefeedback from developers has been very positive and they are excited aboutdeveloping solution-driven Newton products for these and other targetmarkets.Q. What is your previous experience?A. I've been at Apple about ten years. I first worked in Quality Assuranceon the Apple II gs (remember that?), and then moved to SoftwareConfiguration Management for the Macintosh. About four years ago Itransferred to the Newton Hardware group, where I program managed thevarious Newton Fax Modems and helped with the MessagePad 110. For the pastthree years, I have been in the Newton Software group. Having worked in allthese areas has really helped me see & understand issues from manyperspectives.Prior to Apple, I owned and managed a 64-seat restaurant in South LakeTahoe for four years. That was great experience, but believe me, Apple &Newton have been much more positive!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*MARKETING FRONT*   MIKE ZIMMERS, SOLUTIONS MARKETING MANAGERQ: What is your role within the Newton Group?A: I work for Barbara Groth in the Solutions Marketing Department. Myspecific area of responsibility is managing the relations with third-partydevelopers for selected vertical markets.Q: What does "vertical markets" mean?A: To us, a "vertical market" is an industry or a focused usage model thathas a particular use for the Newton OS devices.Q: What markets is NSG targeting?While NSG is supportive of third-party development in many areas, we arefocused on six areas for 1997:- Sales Force Automation- Field Service- Transportation- Inside Plant- Health Care- EducationEach of these areas has selected market segments that we intend to focus on.Q: Why are these markets important to the success of the Newton?A: Consumer awareness of hand-held personal computers (HPCs) is still verylimited. Most people, even those who own personal computers and/or cellulartelephones, aren't motivated to purchase a HPC, or even to learn more aboutthem. In such an environment, a high-end product like Newton is going toface intense competition from less-expensive products, because the consumerisn't equipped to make an informed value judgement. To this person, we're aFerrari and they're still deciding whether to learn to drive.In certain industries, however, people have used HPCs (or at leasthand-held devices like RF terminals) for years. The application for them iswell-understood, but the current products are, in many instances, wellbehind the technology curve. In these vertical markets, Newton can be anexciting, compelling alternative.Q: What do you see as Newton's competitive advantage in these markets?There are several. To begin with, most of the hand-held devices in some ofthese markets cost $3000 and up, making Newton a cost-saving alternative.We believe that the MP2000 and Newton OS are much more powerful andflexible than any other HPC on the market, giving integrators theopportunity to incorporate more functionality into the handheld device.Handwriting recognition is a plus, as is the high-resolution display. Ourlong battery life is also an advantage that cannot be overstated.Q: What is NSG going to do to attack these markets?We are currently defining a Whole Product Solution (WPS) for each segmentwe've identified within the markets. We intend to evangelize the missingpieces within our developer community, and build some market momentum byguiding developers toward filling in some of these gaps for us. We're alsolooking at ways to help our VARs and SIs better reachthese markets.On a more long-term basis, we're polling our developers, both existing andpotential, to better understand what base-product improvements would makeNewton OS devices more effective in these markets.Q: Are you available to Newton developers?Absolutely. I rely heavily on our developer community for all kinds ofNewton-related feedback. They are truly my eyes and ears. I'm also here tohelp them in any way I can. People should feel free to contact me atanytime.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*VENDOR SPLENDOR*     GEOIDE AND WAVERLEY REVIEWEDGEOIDE^^^^^^GEOIDE Systemes S.A., a Vernon FRANCE based company, was founded in 1994 todevelop and market accesories for Apple MessagePads.The well-known protective case, the Rubber-Boot, was our first product forthe MP 110, MP 120, MP 130 and a version for the MP 2000 will be availablein May.The new Rubber-Boot for the MP 2000 has been the object of careful studies.Not only is it particularly well designed, but it also protects theMessagePad from bumps and falls very efficiently. In order to remove iteasily, it is made of two parts, and it allows the horizontal and verticaluse of the MessagePad for both the right and left handed.A ski pole strap allows for a safe firm grip of the device. An optionalcamera strap is also available in our range of products. This boot will beavailable in five standard colors; black, grey, red, blue, and yellow.There will also be the option of bi-color combinations (one color on eachpart). In order to protect the MessagePad from water and dust, a specialmylar and plastic screen called the "splash-screen" will also be availablein May among Géoïde's products.With the recent release of the MP 2000, Géoïde Systèmes has developed awell designed laser code bar reader that directly plugs in theinter-connect port (no wire, no battery, it's like a plug). This readerwill be called the Scan2000. Scan2000 will have very small dimensions, andis able to read all standard code bar. The reading range is within 2" to30". This reader will be available in mid-May. A special Rubber-boot willbe also available to protect both the MP 2000 and Scan2000Géoïde Systèmes also provides a range of accessories for the MP 2000:Rubber-Boots, Addon Printers, IR Belt Printers, Addon GSM (September) andHolsters.For more information please contactGéoïde SystèmesTel : 33 2 32 21 17 50Fax : 33 2 32 21 17 60email : geoidsys@imaginet.frWAVERLEY SOFTWARE^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Waverley Software Design Inc., develops and markets innovative softwareproducts for the Newton platform. Founded in 1993, we provide both customsolutions for our clients and applications for consumers. We have justintroduced a new application called Workout Log which tracks, graphs andlogs fitness information, and have also recently developed EZRx for EZ CelTech, Inc, a mobile prescription writing and management application forhealth care professionals.Workout Log is the fast, flexible and fun way to record and analyze yourworkouts. Using Workout Log as a fitness companion, you can manage yourfitness information and improve your training effectiveness. Theapplication is Newton 2.0 savvy and works with any Newton 2.0 device.Workout Log has many features which make it an ideal solution for trackingyour progress. First of all, it can accept several different types of inputdata including numeric, date, time and text. The flexible data entryformats allow you to even enter values such as "12 miles" into a numericentry field. Secondly, Workout Log can handle multiple values per fieldmaking it easy to record intervals or weight lifting sets. Third, each logentry can accept data which is unique to that individual log entry. Forexample, if you normally record three or four parameters while training formarathoning, you can add race specific data such as place to that race'slog entry. Workout Log also has a unique milestone tracking feature whichcan be used to record a new maximum weight lifted or information about newrunning shoes or bicycle parts. You can then create summaries beginningfrom the milestone date which show you how much wear and tear your fitnessequipment is accumulating or what your activity has been since achievingthe milestone. The summary feature can also summarize performance over anyperiod of time, showing average, min, max or totals for any field.Summaries can provide you with your average weekly heart rate, maximumweight lifted or total distance you've biked last month. Lastly, WorkoutLog's graphing capability can help you visualize your training data. Youcan graph any of the fields defined for each different sport over anylength of time.Waverley Software Design is also an active Newton platform developerfocusing on working with our clients to analyze problems and design andimplement software solutions which capitalize on the potential of Newtontechnology. If you are considering a Newton solution, please contact us.For more information on Workout Log or on developing a custom solution,please contact Matt Brown at (415) 322-5356 or by sending email toWaverleySD@aol.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TECHIE TIP*J. CHRISTOPHER BELL, DTS ENGINEERWORD PROCESSING IN NEWTON 2.1 OSThe MessagePad 2000 and eMate 300 are Apple's first devices with the Newton2.1 OS. Newton 2.1 offers compatibility with programs written for previousNewton devices and offers new features for users and developers. One newfeature is the Newton Text Engine, also called protoTXView.One important feature of protoTXView is support for efficient display andediting of very large documents. Because it supports Virtual Binary Objectsfor displaying and editing, size is primarily limited by each user'sstorage space. It also provides features like rulers, page breaks,sketch/picture support, and provides paragraph-by-paragraph control ofindents, tabs, line spacing, and horizontal justification (center, full,etc). All these text attributes can be modified or read programmatically.If you are designing an application to exchange large text documents withdesktop applications, protoTXView can be a useful tool for displaying andediting the data on the Newton device. Also, you might consider usingprotoTXView to provide more flexibility for formatting text for printingand importing/exporting text with the desktop.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TOP PROJECT*ETE's QUICKFLIGHT(R) WIRELESS AND GPS TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE MESSAGEPADETE, Inc. of San Diego, California demonstrated the latest in wireless andnavigation technologies on the new, handheld Apple MessagePad(TM) 2000 atthe Comdex'96 exposition in Las Vegas.  ETE adds a completely new dimensionto the use of Newton-enabled handheld devices. Applications designed todate, or under development, could assist American military personnel whoreceive critical information during combat or how civilians are warned attimes of natural disaster, such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes,or how police officers respond to a crime scene or receive time-criticaltraffic information.ETE and MITRE Corporation demonstrated a prototype hardware and softwaresystem known as TASR or Tactical Automated Situation Receiver. At the coreof TASR's innovative technology is an Apple MessagePad, a GlobalPositioning System receiver, a wireless 2-way radio, MITRE proprietarysoftware and ETE's proprietary QuickFlight(R) wireless communicationssoftware. TASR, its creators believe, represents the first in a series ofhandheld devices that will incorporate the ultimate portable warning systemthat has significate potential to improve hazard avoidance techniques andprotect human life in both military and civilian applications.The TASR system demonstrated a new concept for disseminating warning andkey situation awareness information to in-field forces over hand-helddevices, specifically for this demonstration using the Apple MessagePad2000. Key features of the system include: (1) the broadcast of informationdirectly to in-field personnel, (2) proprietary processing of thisinformation for improved mission effectiveness, and (3) display of relevantinformation both graphically (show relationship to receiver location) andtextually (for event details) with alarm. The use of broadcast alsominimizes bandwidth utilization and allows silent unit operation.  Thein-field units will use moving maps to aid navigation and provide areference for information overlays (e.g. areas where threats are imminent).TASR leverages manually scanned maps, DMA Topographic Line Maps, and othermapping products to provide maps in several scales. TASR Map display modesinclude: (1) moving map centered at user GPS derived location, (2)stationary map with user GPS position and movement history plotted, and (3)user selected map region without position plotting. Scale changes preservethe actively displayed map area for continuity of reference. The mapcapability supports entry, editing, and display of way points along routesas well as navigation points of significance to the user. Distance andheading from one point to another can be calculated by touching the pointlocations on the Apple MessagePad 2000 screen. Cross track distances from aspecified route are calculated at defined and programmable intervals whilethe unit is navigating. The actual path traversed may be displayed andstored automatically for later reference if desired. Map and situation datawill be automatically updated from the server as units move across theaffected event area.Two-way communications capabilities permit Apple MessagePad 2000s tocollect and report changes (e.g., damaged areas, critical asset locations,operational status) and key events (e.g., threat position and activity,chemical/biological events) on the affected region. In addition, unitposition and movement may be monitored at the server and redistributed toother in-field units. Standard report forms are supported with basicinformation already filled in (e.g., unit identity, unit position and timeof report). Event locations distant from the user are specified usingdrawing techniques based on map, heading and distance, or known objectselection techniques.The TASR project contains many integrated, off-the-shelf features of ETE'sQuickFlight Wireless software and it's proprietary MobileTrak(R) AutomaticVehicle Location System, including the QuickFlight Wireless Server, theMobileTrak Mapping Display Server software, the QuickFlight Wireless Clientfor Newton, customized moving map display software as well as othercustomized software developed specifically for the TASR/ISR (TASRInteractive Situation Reporting) project.For more information, contact Howard Griffith, VP International BusinessDevelopment, (619)793-5400, Fax: (619)793.6060, Email: wireless@ete.com orETEsales@aol.com, Website: http://www.ete.com.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*CALENDAR         MARK YOUR CALENDAR!!|X X X X X||# # # # #|              * The Newton Systems Group will have a|# # # # #|                presence in the following upcoming events:|# # # # #|NMHCC                 April 14-17, 1997                    Washington DCThe NMHCC (National Managed Health Care Congress) is the largest managedcare conference in the United States, and as such the Newton Systemsgroup will be sponsoring a pavilion in conjunction with many of ourHealth Care solutions developers.
