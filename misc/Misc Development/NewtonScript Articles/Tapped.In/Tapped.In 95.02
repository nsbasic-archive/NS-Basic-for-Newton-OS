Development Group?       @  | /@      @   |/  @         A: The PIE large Business Development group is       @     @             chartered with creating demand for the MessagePad          @                through solutions development. To that end we haveboth vertical and horizontal market managers as well as technical resourcesdedicated to helping our large business customers deploy Newton projects. We do this through a scalable business model that is fully dependent uponleveraging the core competencies of our VAR, SI and ISV partners.  To date,joint marketing and solutions development efforts have been key in all ourefforts and have contributed greatly to proving the success of theplatform. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^¥   MARKETING FRONT     INTERVIEW WITH PATTY TULLOCH, Product Marketing Mgr.              XX        Q: Can you tell us about the new MP 120 features?             XX            XX          A: The newest member of Apple's Newton MessagePad      XX   XX              family of products is the MessagePad 120.        XXX                Responding to customer feedback, the MessagePad 120                           will be available in a 1MB and 2MB configuration,with the 2MB model providing users with nearly triple the user storage space ascompared to the MessagePad 110.  This additional memory can be used to storemore custom and third party software in the product's internal memory, thusfreeing up the PCMCIA slot for add-on communications products and peripherals.Both the 1MB and 2MB versions of the MessagePad 120 have improved features overthe earlier models, which are designed to enhance the product's ease of use anddurability.  Industrial design improvements include a removeable lid, improvedscreen visibility, and a PCMCIA lock located on the side, allowing for fast andeasy removal of PCMCIA cards when the lid is folded back. Improvements for mobile communications solutions were also made. The PCMCIAslot on the MessagePad 120 now has more than double the power rating, from 115mA in the 110 to 325 mA in the 120, enabling MessagePad owners to use add-oncommunications products and peripherals which require additional power.Examples of such applications include high power modems for radio frequency andwireless local area networking solutions. Depending on which version of the MessagePad users buy they will also receiveadditional third-party software solutions enhancing productivity andcommunications capabilities. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^¥  VENDOR SPLENDOR      TPS ELECTRONICS AND DIGITAL OCEAN INC.

Make sure that theapplication can easily be removed if a user wishes (no special patches, etc.). Enclose an electronic read-me file with TWO parts:  1)  How the presentershould 'position' the demo--include what type of customer would use theapplication, why they would use it, cost/benefit issues, and other relevantinformation.  2)  How to 'demonstrate' the application-- step-by-stepinstructions with any pertinent information along the way.  Read-me filesshould be 2 pages or less.  Application size can be as large as you like, butwe recommend keeping it to a minimum necessary for an effective demo.  DON'TFORGET to put 'dummy' data in the application so that the presenter has a storyto tell that the audience can relate to.

A:  It turns out that LCD displays have problems when         ??             you use large areas of 50% gray (or even black).  That         ?              is when large areas are in a checkerboard pattern of onand off pixels.  This is a problem called "crosstalk" by hardware folks.Basically, the LCD has problems keeping up the refresh rate under thiscondition.  That means things like '3D style' buttons and lots of filled areasare not a good idea. It results in dim-looking screens and also a fasterbattery drain. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^¥  LAUGH--              --AT US, NOT WITH US       (X  X)           This month's joke compliments of Newton                        Consulting Engineer, Peter Hermsen      @@    @@        @@@@            Q:  What does PCMCIA stand for? A:  1)  Personal Computer Memory Card International Association.    2)  People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^¥  PREMIER INTEGRATOR   CONGRATULATIONS Integration Systems Inc.!         **        ****            Integration Systems, Inc. has won this month's Premier     ***********        Integrator Award!
