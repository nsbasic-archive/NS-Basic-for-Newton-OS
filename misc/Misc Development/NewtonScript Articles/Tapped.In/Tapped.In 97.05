What is your role inside NSG, and what does your group do?A. I'm one of eight Engineering Program Managers in NSG - my area ofspecialty is Newton development tools. I'm responsible for managingthese projects to ensure that they meet specific goals for quality,cost, feature set, and schedule.Q. That sounds a lot like what a project manager does. What's thedifference between a project manager and a program manager?A. A "project" is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a uniqueproduct or service. A "program" is a group of related projects managedin a coordinated way. For example, I'm currently managing the deliveryof multiple versions of Newton Toolkit (NTK) on the MacOS and Windowsplatforms. As the single point of contact for these projects, I am inthe ideal position to ensure that NTK issues - whether identified bydevelopers on Mac or Windows platforms - are addressed by the team.Q. Speaking of NTK, can you give us an update on its status?A. Sure! Newton Toolkit 1.6 for Windows (WinNTK) is available now. Itsreceiving such tremendous support from the developer community that weoccasionally go into back order on it. Contrary to what you may haveread in some newsgroups, the back order situation never lasts longerthan a few days. We are monitoring demand carefully to ensure that wehave adequate inventory to meet developers' needs.We're also developing updaters for WinNTK 1.6 and Mac NTK 1.6 that addsupport for grayscale and screen sizes used by the eMate 300 andMessagePad 2000 devices. These updaters will be provided via the NewtonDevelopment site on the WorldWideWeb at(http://devworld.apple.com/dev/newtondev.shtml). Beta versions should beposted by the time you read this issue of Tapped.In.Q. Are you working on any other projects?A. In fact, multiple versions of NTK are *not* enough to keep me out oftrouble :-) I'm also managing Newton Internet Enabler 1.1-D and ModemSetups for the German Newton OS, as well as some things that, for now,will need to remain under wraps (he said, mysteriously....)Q. You've been at Apple for a while. What is your history here?A. Some of you (ok, maybe just my Mom) will recognize my name from thewriters' credits on two editions of the Newton Programmer's Guide.Before coming to the Newton Systems Group, I wrote several editions ofMacApp documentation in Apple's Developer Press group. Before that, Iput in a couple years in Apple's Software QA group. And a reeeeeeallylong time ago, I used to answer the phone in Mac DTS. But if youremember that, we probably shouldn't admit our ages!^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*MARKETING FRONT*   DAVID BERMAN, PRODUCT MARKETING MANAGERYou recently joined NSG what where you doing before and what is your newrole?I am the Product Marketing Manager for Newton Development Tools. Ijoined the group from AppleSoft where I was Product Marketing Manger forRapid Application Development Tools. Before that I held a number ofpositions in Business Development and Evangelism focused on developmenttools, database and middleware.As Product Marketing Manager, what are your main responsibilities, haveyou made any changes since starting?My main focus is on the Newton Toolkit products and development toolsstrategy. The first change I made was to lower the price on NewtonToolkit by half, I want more developers to jump in and try Newtondevelopment. We shipped Newton Toolkit 1.6 for Windows in March. Thiswas a major milestone for the tools efforts in NSG and it was great tostart with this important product already on it's way to developers. Inaddition to NTK for MacOS and NTK for Windows, I am responsible fordeveloping a tools strategy that will support NSG's business focus. Weare looking at the trends in software development for handheld devicesand tracking carefully what our competition is doing in this area.How has the Windows product been received?The Newton Toolkit for Windows 1.6 has been warmly received. Shipmentsare above our expectations. Many of the customers I talk to are pleasedto see that their choice of desktop platform does not restrict theirability to do Newton software development. More importantly this productintroduces Newton to a whole new group of programmers that has not hadaccess to Newton tools before. We want Newton development to beaccessible to a many people as possible.What is in the future for Newton Toolkit?We have several updates to both the MacOS and Windows version this year.These will be updates to NTK 1.6 users and will be available via our website. The most important features will be support for our new products (eMate 300 and MessagePad 2000 ). The 1.6.1 Windows update and the 1.6.4MacOS update will be out later this year. We are also seeding betaversions to our program members prior to general availability.What else is in store for software development on Newton?I would like to increase our focus on developers doing verticalapplications as well as the package application vendors. We need tobetter meet the needs of these developers. I would like to hear from asmany developers as possible ( both vertical and packaged software )about their requirements and issues regarding tools.How can they reach you with their comments?They can send e-mail to berman@newton.apple.com or call me at 408974-2285.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*VENDOR SPLENDOR*    ABCOM & TELETYPE REVIEWEDABCOM^^^^^ABCOM, located at the base of the Sierra Nevada in easternCalifornia, has been designing and manufacturing personal computeraccessories since 1984. What began as a small offering of protectivedust covers for the first Apple computers, has now become a large,successful line of covers, carrying cases, and keyboard skins for allkinds of Macintosh and PC hardware.In addition to outstanding customer service, the key to ABCOM's successhas been its commitment to research and design.

Previously, you only had three ports to choose from: thebuilt-in serial port, the PCMCIA slot and the IR port. With theMessagePad 2000, you now have two PCMCIA slots, an internal serial port,an external serial port, and an IR port.To help with serial port selection, a function has been added to theplatform file. The function is called kGetCommPortInfoFunc and itreturns an array of communication port frames.To filter out a particular serial port, use the hardwareLoc slot of acommunication port frame to determine whether that port should beremoved from the list.For more information on using kGetCommPortInfoFunc, please read thePlatform File documention included on Newton Developer CD #13. This CDwill be available to members of Newton developer programs in June.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*TOP PROJECT*     THE MESSAGEPAD IS A KEY INGREDIENT FOR CAMPBELL SOUPThe German office of the Campbell Soup Company recently set out toimprove its sales and distribution system, and customer service whilecutting down the time between ordering and delivery. Its recipe forsuccess included , an Apple MessagePad, a mobile phone and a customizedapplication by Newton developer Pythia Communication & Computers, GmbHfrom Starnberg, Germany that allows data to be transferred directly tothe central inventory management system.The main goal for Campbell was to reduce the time between ordering anddelivery by half. In the past, sales reps collected order lists fromcustomers and faxed them to central office at the end of each day.There, the order information was inputted into the inventory managementsystem and the delivery schedule set up. Even when everything wasrunning smoothly, it took four to five days for customers to receivetheir goods, and, because orders were processed manually twice, errorscould easily creep into the system. Reinhard Eschbach, Campbell'sbusiness Systems Director in Germany, also found room for improvement inthe communication between sales reps, regional managers and centraloffice. Effective communication is crucial for both the customer, whoneeds immediate information on product availability, and the sales reps,who depend on up-to-date information regarding current promotions,special offers, discontinued articles and the opening of new businesses.Finally, the regional manager needs to be constantly informed of thefield staff's activities in order to provide them with the rightsupport. Until now, no communications system has been able to provideall that on a daily basis.In April 1997, Campbell's sales reps starting working with Pythia'ssolution, SyncServer.  SyncServer was used to design a speciallydeveloped solution for Campbell, but it also works as a standardproduct. This server controls the data exchange between the mobileclients, the inventory management system and Campbell's SalesInformation System, both of which are run on an AS/400 at the centraloffice. Over 50 sales reps have been equipped with a MessagePad thatstores customer information as well as product data and a mobile phone.Orders are inputted on location. After leaving the customer, the salesrep plugs the MessagePad into a mobile phone and transfers the orderdata directly to the central office. As well as only taking only a fewminutes to transfer, the possibility of errors are avoided because theinformation is only inputted once and delivery time is cut in half.Furthermore, the sales rep is notified immediately if an item is notavailable. At every data transfer the SyncServer processes new databetween the MessagePad and the central office, allowing the most currentinformation to be automatically downloaded to each rep's MessagePad. Atthe same time, the regional manager is notified each time a rep calls ona customer, which can be crucial for the timing of promotionalcampaigns. The system proves its usefulness in many ways, for example,field scheduling - which can be tedious when carried out by hand - isperformed centrally by the new system, ensuring that every rep hasaccess to the current schedule on their MessagePad. Customer data suchas market information, current sales figures and delivery details canalso be called up before every customer visit. An especially usefulfunction is the running travel expenses account that is continuouslyupdated by the system. Eschbach sees Campbell carrying out Intranet datatransactions in the near future. No problem for the MessagePad installedwith a Web browser. According to Eschbach, compatibility with numerouscommunications systems, including ISDN, modems, GSM, TCP/IP and theInternet, was the main reason Campbell chose the MessagePad as well asits user-friendliness, which makes it easy to learn how to use even themost complex applications.For more information please contact Petr Bradatsch with PythiaCommunication & Computer GmbH at 011-49-8151-2716-10 orbradatsch@pythia.de.
