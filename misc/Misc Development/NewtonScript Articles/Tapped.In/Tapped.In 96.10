What is your role as Marketing Director for NSG? XXXX XX                    A. I believe that I have four major responsibilities XX                      as leader of the marketing team:* Drive future product direction* Ensure successful, cost effective and impactful marketing communications   (including advertising, PR, Direct Mail, on-line marketing, collateralmaterials and    events)* Identify and establish close relationships with key solutions providers* Lead, manage and mentor the NSG marketing teamDRIVE FUTURE PRODUCT DIRECTION: We have exciting new products being launched asthis article is written. The obvious question to me is "Where do we go fromhere?" We have a number of ideas and plans in the works and I will be workingwith the Product Managers to develop a future product roadmap that is driven bycustomer needs. We will be assessing market demand in a number of marketsegments, understanding the specific and unique needs of those sets ofcustomers,and developing product concepts with feature descriptions in order to plot ourfuture product direction.ENSURE SUCCESSFUL, COST EFFECTIVE & IMPACTFUL MARKETING COMMUNICATIONSEvery hightechnology company is faced with the challenge of cost cutting and maximizingreturn on investment for limited marketing dollars. In NSG in 1997, we haveenough funds to meet our sales objectives (of course, we would always like tohave MORE). At the same time, we have more products to market and more uniquecustomer groups to reach. We also face the reality of Windows CE and thetraditional Microsoft Publicity/Advertising/Direct Mail Blitz. As a result, wewill need to leverage the creativity that Apple is so well known for in order tocompete for the customer's mind share. Fortunately, Apple historically"out-creates" Microsoft. We plan to do so in 1997 more than ever. Inaddition, wealso have the recent Internet/Web phenomena which NSG Marketing will beutilizingfor maximum effect in the coming months. We're in the midst of hiring a devotedOn-Line Marketing Manager who will be focused entirely on Internet/Web-basedmarketing.IDENTIFY & ESTABLISH CLOSE RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY SOLUTIONS PROVIDERS NSGMarketing just completed staffing up its Solutions Marketing team. BarbaraGroth,the manager of the group, will be focusing her team on a number of marketsegments including Health Care, Education, Communications, and BusinessProfessionals. This is only a partial list of target customer groups thatwe willfocus on in 1997.LEAD, MANAGE & MENTOR THE NSG MARKETING TEAM This is an internal objective thatis critical for any team of people. I am fortunate to have such talented andhard-working individuals on the team and will be working closely with them todevelop a world class marketing organization.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^VENDOR SPLENDORVV     VVVV     VV          HOLOSOFT, INC. VV   VV           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  VV VV            Holosoft, Inc. was founded in February of 1994   VVV             for the purpose of developing a spreadsheet that targeted                   business users in the Newton market.  The results of thiseffort is Equate, a spreadsheet with a focus on Excel compatibility.Equate is now in it's second major revision continuing to build on the originalgoal of excellent Excel compatibility. When used with Equate Connect, users canimport or export any size spreadsheet from their desktop, preserving theformulas, number formats, column widths, text styles, and left and rightalignment. Equate Connect performs this function without any intermediate stepsrequired. Working directly with the Excel files, it will determine the version,perform the appropriate translation and send it to the Newton. The next timeEquate is started, the new spreadsheets and workbooks are ready to go. Whenimporting files created in Excel version 5 or above, the Workbooks arrive on theNewton intact.Besides the obvious application of taking your important spreadsheets with youwherever you go, some users have found use for Equate's unlimited spreadsheetsize by importing large databases into Excel, and downloading them to theNewton.Data is easily located in Equate by performing a search and tapping on the founditem jumping to that location in the sheet.Holosoft continues to improve upon Equate and intends to fully support theMessagePad 2000 with features that were impractical before because of speed.Equate Connect is currently available for Windows and should be available forbeta testing for Macintosh about the time you are reading this. Equate 2.0 isavailable now for both platforms. The Holosoft beta program is open to anyregistereduser of Equate 2.0. If you are interested in becoming a beta tester, send yourrequest via email to support@4Holosoft.com.Holosoft can be reached at (408) 748-9648, fax (408) 970-9323.

During the years that followed, several Macintosh applicationswere released including MacAuto, FetchIt, FolderJump and KopyKat.In August 1993, SilverWARE changed direction and addressed the need for qualitysoftware for the Newton platform. A year later in August of 1994, SilverWAREdeveloped and published MoreInfoª, the first contact manager for the Newton.MoreInfo was the very first Newton product to break ground in several key areasin the Newton market. With expertise in user interface and product design,SilverWARE created a contact manager which appeared seamlessly integrated intothe existing Newton operating system. SilverWARE continued its success in theNewton market with PowerNames, a companion product to MoreInfo. Among otherfeatures, PowerNames allows instant access to frequently used names.MoreInfo andPowerNames achieved their success by bringing needed features to theplatform andprovided them in an innovative and elegant manner.SilverWARE recently released the next generation of its contact manager,MoreInfo4.0. This new version brings many new features to this already powerfulapplication. MoreInfo continues its reputation of providing unique, state of theart features by allowing users to easily link together any number of names,meetings, events, to dos, calls and notes. Whenever users see MoreInfo'strademark "link" icon, they will be able to link items together and instantlyaccess those items that have already been linked. Using a single screen, userscan find, create and link together names, meetings, events, to dos, callsand anytype of note. This simple one window interface makes linking quick andefficient.SilverWARE is a Newton Systems Integrator and has developed third party Newtonproducts. SilverWARE is experienced in the complete software development cycleand provides its services to the Newton market.For more information on SilverWARE products or services, please call (508)521-5262, fax (508) 373-7282 or email at info@silverware.com.

David Fedor, Newton DTS EngineerDoes it seem that you're spending most of your life  watching the downloadindicator on NTK, because you're in an endless cycle of tweaking the codein a function, waiting for you package to download, watching it fail,editing the code, downloading,and on and on?If you're primarily editing a single function, it can save lots of time tooverride the object in memory via the Inspector. For instance, if thefunction inquestion is the buttonClickScript of a button with the text "Calculate", just dothe following in the inspector: debug("Calculate").buttonClickScript := func()begin /* code here */ end;Now select that block of text, hit enter, and retest. This is much faster thanthe whole build/download cycle... but don't forget to copy the code backinto thebrowser once you get it right!To get at spots which debug() can't find easily, try code like:debug("Calculate"):Parent().myOtherMethod := func() begin ... orGetRoot().|myapp:mysig|.viewScrollUpScript := func() begin ...^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*LAUGH--              LOOKING FOR LAUGHS FROM NEWTON DEVELOPERS (X  X)Have you heard any funny Newton stories lately?

EachMessagePad was equipped with a Megahertz Allpoints Wireless PC Card and ETE'sQuickFlight Wireless software.  Participants were able to transmit their scoreswirelessly back to the club house where a Macintosh Powerbook (equipped with aFourth Dimension database, ETE's QuickFlight Wireless Server software, and aMegahertz Wireless PC Card) functioned as the data receiving station. Thereceiving station then compiled the scores and automatically redistributed thedata, updating the wirelessly enabled, leaderboard which was projected on alargescreen - all in seconds.Although proud of the WiNGS solution, David Ringsmuth, president of BusinessBrothers, made sure tournament attendees were aware that the technology behindWiNGS had far-reaching implications for the future of business and not just thesport of golf. He commented that golfing was a perfect analogy to how peoplecurrently run their businesses. Like golfers who use a paper scorecard and thentally the results at the end of play, there are thousands of businesses relyingon paper-loaded strategies that delay the processing of critical data. Look atthe forms we all use - invoices, work orders, bid sheets, check lists, contracts- all of them can be easily setup for on-the-spot electronic entry, signaturesincluded, and immediate wireless transmission using the tools we used today onthe golf course. "Why not enter data once and be able to expect up-to-the-minuteinformation that isn't delayed by the normal 24, 48 and even 72 hour turnaround?" He added, "one of the golfers doesn't want to know how theircompetitorsare doing during a tournament, but I'd be surprised to find anyone here whowouldturn down that kind of information if it was related to their business, theindustry, or their competition."The wireless technology demonstrated at this tournament could providesignificant benefits to tournament golf and other sporting events as well," saidHoward Griffith, an avid golfer and vice president and business developmentmanager at ETE. "Imagine a system that not only updates a professionaltournament's leaderboard in real time, but also simultaneously distributes thedata to multiple destinations. Scores would be instantaneously available fortelevision broadcast and Internet feeds, resulting in the immediate transfer ofthe information around the world."Wintel users and businesses with mixed computing environments can also benefitsince every element of the solution demonstrated at the tournament is fullyfunctional on both Macintosh and Windows platforms and on a variety of thirdparty hardware. Current and future wireless solutions can also connect Newtonusers to the mainframes of large corporations as well as to the home office ofone-person businesses. By adding internet email software, integrated scheduling,contact management, time billing, and other tools, the hand-held MessagePad canbe a real productivity booster. Ringsmuth added, "Since integrating Newton andwireless technologies into our work, the realm of solutions we offer our clientshas more than doubled."The complete solution for WiNGS may vary from tournament to tournament, but thebasic setup includes the mobile computing devices (like Apple's Newton-basedMessagePad), wireless modems, a few workstations and the wireless softwaretechnologies to tie it all together.  Business Brothers hopes todemonstrate thistechnology solution to PGA Tour officials and other tournament organizers in thenear future.Contacts: David Ringsmuth at Business Brothers at 612-853-3024, 106, or email atdavid_ringsmuth@bbros.com, Howard Griffith, ETE Wireless at 619-793-5400, oremail at hgriffith@ete.com.
