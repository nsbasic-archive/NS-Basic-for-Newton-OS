# NS-Basic-for-Newton-OS

It's a miracle this even exists.

The experience of resurrecting this software is similar to the odyssey of Mason Mark, [detailed here](https://github.com/masonmark/Dash-Board-for-Newton-OS).

Feel free to look at the code, try to run it and have fun.

Go ahead and open issues - I won't be fixing any of them. 
Seriously, it's 25 years since I've looked at the source. 
I have no idea how to get the [Newton Toolkit](https://www.macintoshrepository.org/1383-newton-toolkit) running - you'll need that to compile it.
