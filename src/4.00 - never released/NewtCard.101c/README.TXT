Starting NewtCard--------------------Tap on the NewtCard icon in the Extras drawer. It will open to the Home stackif you have it installed.  To run one of the stacks you installed from theStacks Folder, tap the Overview button and select one.3. Diskette Contents--------------------The diskette contains the following files:NewtCard.pkg  The NewtCard programNewtDraw.pkg  The Draw module for NewtCard. Only load this if you have              a MessagePad.

Adding Additional Sounds and Stamps---------------------------------------You can specifiy sounds to be played when opening or closing cards, backgroundsor the stack, as well as when a button is pressed.A variety of sounds are buit into the eMate and MessagePad. Additional soundscan easily be added: here are a couple of sites with sounds that will work withNewtCard.http://deepfocus.com/newton/SoundIcons.shtml  system sounds, misc.http://www.tactile.com/downloads.html	      a great collection ofsounds, including Star Wars, Princess Bride, RoboCop, WarGames and more!You can also expand the number of stamps that appear in the Draw module.Visit Tall Hill Software (http://home.earthlink.net/~kakes/tallhill/products/newton/stamps.html)for Star Wars, Simpsons, and Star Trek sets.Visit Newton Underground (http://www.newton-underground.com/NU/software/index.shtml)for their Youth Corruption Stamps.To enable speech, you need the MacInTalk TTS module. This was never officiallyby Apple, but you can download it from http://www.rit.edu/~nwh5408/newton/newtonpack.html5. Moving stacks between systems--------------------------------The PackIt option on the Action Slip can be used to turn the current soup intoa Newton package. The will take a few seconds for a small stack (longer for alarge one), and requires that you have approximately twice the size of theStack left as free space.The package can be moved to a Mac or PC desktop by using XPort.To move a package from one Newton to another, you can beam it, email it, orsend it by any of the other Newton transports.The packages are self extracting stacks. Once on the new Newton, tap on them,and they will turn into NewtCard stacks. When the extraction is complete, youcan delete the package: the information will have been transferred into theStores directory.6.
